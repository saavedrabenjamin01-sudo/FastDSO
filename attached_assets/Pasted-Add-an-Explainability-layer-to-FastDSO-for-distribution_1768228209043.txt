Add an Explainability layer to FastDSO for distribution and forecast outputs. Use MIN_WOC and MAX_WOC consistently.

Goal:
For each suggested row, provide a human-readable explanation of WHY the system suggested that quantity, without changing the quantity itself.

Scope:
- Distribution suggestions (Prediction rows)
- Forecast purchase results (Forecast V2 outputs)
- Optional: redistribution suggestions (store-to-store) if available

Definitions:
- MIN_WOC / MAX_WOC are the coverage thresholds used in logic.
- WOC = stock / max(avg_weekly_sales, 1)

Requirements:

1) Distribution (Prediction) explainability
For each prediction row (SKU-store):
Provide explanation bullets based on data already available:
- Sales driver:
  - avg_weekly_sales used (method: SMA3/SMA2/Last week)
  - history window applied (e.g., last 3 weeks)
- Stock driver:
  - current store stock used
  - store WOC estimated
  - whether store was below MIN_WOC (risk)
- Constraint driver:
  - CD stock availability (snapshot date)
  - whether the suggestion was capped/limited by CD stock
- If stockout replenishment layer exists:
  - explicitly state “Stockout replenishment applied” and why (store stock 0 + historical sales)

Output format (example):
"Suggested because:
 • Store stock is 0 units (WOC below MIN_WOC)
 • Avg weekly sales (last 3 weeks): 5
 • Target coverage: 2.5 weeks
 • CD stock available: 20 (snapshot 2026-01-07)
 • Final assigned quantity after constraints: 8"

2) Forecast (Purchase Forecast V2) explainability
For each SKU:
Explain using:
- avg weekly demand
- horizon_weeks
- lead_time_weeks
- safety_stock_pct
- CD stock
- suggested_purchase formula result
Example:
"Suggested purchase because:
 • Avg weekly demand: 12
 • Horizon: 8 weeks, Lead time: 4 weeks
 • Safety stock: 10%
 • Current CD stock: 30
 • Required units: 144, Suggested purchase: 114"

3) UI
- Add a small “Why?” icon/button per row in tables:
  - Distribution table rows
  - Forecast table rows (mass result)
- Clicking opens a Bootstrap modal showing the bullet explanation.
- Do NOT clutter the table; keep it minimal.
- Explanations are generated at runtime, no DB persistence needed.

4) Safety / robustness
- If any data is missing, explanation must say “Data not available” instead of crashing.
- Preserve leading zeros in SKU display.
- Do NOT change calculation outputs.

Deliverables:
- Helper functions to generate explanation text (distribution + forecast)
- Template changes adding “Why?” buttons and modal
- Minimal JS to populate modal content
- Confirm no functional regressions.
