CATEGORY DASHBOARD UPGRADE — Improve visual + add “Suggested Actions” for No-Movement SKUs (fast & actionable)

Context:
We have a Category Dashboard that shows:
- category KPIs
- a status breakdown (active vs no movement)
- a “No movement” list/drilldown
Management requested that the “No movement” section becomes actionable, with suggested actions and quick workflows.

STRICT RULES
- Do NOT change core data logic or calculations.
- Keep Macro Sales as the source of truth.
- Keep page fast: no large tables loaded by default.
- Actions must work via lightweight links or POSTs; no heavy UI frameworks.

REQUIREMENTS

A) Visual cleanup (light)
1) Make the “SKU status” section clearer:
- Add a small “Suggested actions” card next to the status bar.
- Use FastDSO pill/badge style consistent with Alerts page.
2) Ensure spacing and typography match FastDSO Dashboard.

B) Suggested actions for “No movement”
For SKUs classified as “No movement” (stock > 0 and no sales in window):
1) Add per-row actions (small buttons/icons):
- “Send to Slow Stock” (flags eligible_for_distribution=false + computes risk score)
- “View in Stock Query” (opens stock_query filtered by SKU)
- “View in Alerts” (opens alerts filtered by SKU)
2) Add group actions (bulk):
- Add checkbox selection for rows in the “No movement” list page.
- Add a top action bar:
  - “Send selected to Slow Stock”
  - “Export selected”
  - “Clear selection”
3) Add one prominent action for management:
- “Send ALL no-movement SKUs to Slow Stock” (with confirm modal)
This must:
- run server-side
- process only the filtered dataset (category + window + optional store filter)
- show a success summary (count flagged)

C) Suggested action text (business friendly)
Add a small “Suggestion” label for each no-movement SKU:
Use simple rules:
- If CD stock high and stores stock low: “Consider redistribution / avoid purchase”
- If store stock high and sales = 0: “Candidate for liquidation / slow stock”
This is only UI guidance; no new business logic needed.

D) Maintain performance
- The main category dashboard must NOT render the full no-movement list.
- Keep the no-movement list as a drilldown page (already exists).
- Bulk operations must be batched (no per-row DB commits).
- Use pagination (10/page) and keep exports separate.

E) Integration correctness
- “Send to Slow Stock” must:
  - set Product.eligible_for_distribution = false
  - set risk_score and risk_reason
  - write audit log entry
- Links must preserve SKU text leading zeros.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated dashboard_category template (visual improvements + action panel)
- Updated no_movement list page with:
  - row actions
  - bulk select actions
  - “Send all” action
- Minimal backend endpoints for bulk actions if missing
- No regressions and fast load time
