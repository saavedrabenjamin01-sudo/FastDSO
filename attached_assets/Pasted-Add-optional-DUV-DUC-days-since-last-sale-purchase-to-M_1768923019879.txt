Add optional DUV/DUC (days since last sale/purchase) to Macro Sales Upload without breaking anything.

Context:
FastDSO Macro Sales Upload ingests rows with:
sku, store, date, quantity (+ optional product_name, category)
We now want to support two OPTIONAL columns:
- DUV = days since last sale (integer, global per SKU)
- DUC = days since last purchase (integer, global per SKU)
These come as day counts (not dates). The upload must still work if DUV/DUC are missing.

STRICT RULES
- Do NOT break existing macro upload behavior.
- Do NOT make DUV/DUC required.
- Do NOT change distribution logic in this task.
- Do NOT slow down the upload significantly.
- Preserve leading zeros for SKU.

DATA MODEL (minimal)
If you already have SkuLifecycle table, extend it:
- days_since_last_sale_global (Integer, nullable)
- days_since_last_purchase_global (Integer, nullable)
Optionally also store estimated dates:
- last_sale_date_global_est (Date, nullable)
- last_purchase_date_est (Date, nullable)
If you don’t want new date fields, keep only integer fields.

If SkuLifecycle doesn’t exist, create it as lightweight:
- product_id (FK, unique)
- last_sale_date_global (Date nullable) (already computed from macro)
- days_since_last_sale_global (Integer nullable)
- days_since_last_purchase_global (Integer nullable)
- updated_at

UPLOAD LOGIC CHANGES
1) Parsing:
- Accept DUV and DUC columns if present (case-insensitive match after df.columns lower()).
- Convert to numeric int safely:
  - non-numeric -> treat as NULL
  - negative -> treat as NULL
2) Storage:
- For each SKU found in the upload:
  - Upsert Product as usual.
  - Upsert SkuLifecycle record:
    - Set days_since_last_sale_global = DUV if provided
    - Set days_since_last_purchase_global = DUC if provided
    - Always update updated_at
3) Estimation (optional):
- If you store estimated dates:
  - last_sale_date_global_est = today - timedelta(days=DUV)
  - last_purchase_date_est = today - timedelta(days=DUC)
Only set these if DUV/DUC present and valid.
4) Fallback:
- If DUV/DUC not present:
  - Do nothing (keep null), system still can compute last_sale_date_global from macro sales dates.

INTEGRATION (no breaking)
- Ensure existing lifecycle update from macro sales (MAX(date)) remains.
- If both computed last_sale_date_global and DUV exist:
  - Keep computed date as “actual”
  - Use DUV as an additional metric (do not overwrite actual date).
(If you only store integer fields, skip this.)

USAGE (optional but recommended)
Update Alerts / Slow Stock module to use days_since_last_sale_global when available:
- Prefer lifecycle.days_since_last_sale_global for “No movement” / dead stock thresholds.
- Fallback to computed last_sale_date_global from macro if days metric missing.

DELIVERABLES
- Show updated Macro Sales Upload parsing block that reads optional DUV/DUC.
- Show updated SkuLifecycle model fields if changed.
- Confirm upload works with and without DUV/DUC columns.
- Confirm no regressions in other modules.
