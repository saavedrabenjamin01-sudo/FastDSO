HARD MODE — Dashboard UI must match the provided mockup exactly (layout + spacing + visual hierarchy), while preserving ALL existing functionality and variables.

CONTEXT
FastDSO is Flask + Jinja + Bootstrap + custom style.css. Dashboard already works functionally (filters, KPIs, predictions, remanente, exports, runs). The task is ONLY UI layout/styling.

ABSOLUTE RULES
1) Do NOT change backend code, queries, routes, DB, or variable names.
2) Do NOT remove any existing buttons/actions:
   - Apply filters / Clear
   - Export distribution
   - Export remanente
   - Run selector / active run info (if present)
3) Keep current Jinja loops correct:
   - predictions: for p, prod, st in predictions
   - top_sales: use current structure
   - stock_cd_filtered: for cd, prod in stock_cd_filtered
4) Only modify:
   - templates/dashboard.html
   - static/css/style.css (append-only changes under a “Dashboard Mockup” section)
5) Keep sidebar and base.html unchanged.

VISUAL TARGET (MUST MATCH MOCKUP)
The Dashboard page must be structured in 4 stacked zones:

ZONE A — Header + Run summary (top strip)
- A compact header row:
  Left: “Panel”
  Right: a search input “Buscar (globalmente)” (placeholder, can be disabled)
- Immediately below: a single-line “Run summary strip” like:
  “Folio: 300 | Repo Benjamin Saavedra — 2024-01-07 13:23”
  This strip is a small rounded bar with subtle shadow.

ZONE B — Filters row (compact)
- Filters appear in a tight card/strip:
  - Store dropdown
  - Folio text input
  - Responsable text input
  - Buttons: “Aplicar filtros” (primary) and “Limpiar” (secondary)
- Inputs are compact, aligned in one row (wrap if needed but prefer one row).
- Very small vertical spacing between elements.

ZONE C — KPI cards (2 cards only, like mockup)
- Two wide KPI cards side by side:
  Left card: “Top productos vendidos” with big number (e.g., 220)
  Right card: “Stock CD hoy” with big number (e.g., 705,285)
- Each card shows:
  - small title (muted)
  - big bold number
  - small subtle subtext (optional)
- Cards have:
  - rounded corners
  - soft shadow
  - white background
  - subtle blue accent

ZONE D — Main content area
- A single large card container holding:
  1) “Distribución sugerida — <model name>” header row
     - right side: small SKU search input + Export button
  2) Predictions table (compact)
  3) “Remanente CD” section directly below inside the same container:
     - header row with “Remanente CD” title
     - right side: pagination controls (can keep existing pagination)
     - table for remanente preview

IMPORTANT: In the mockup, Top Sales table is NOT displayed as a big full table. It’s summarized via the KPI card only.
So: remove the big Top Sales table block from the dashboard view, but do NOT remove the backend data. Just don’t render it as a main table.
If you still want a preview, limit to a tiny 5-row preview inside the KPI card using very small text (optional).

FUNCTIONALITY MUST REMAIN
- Filters must still work and persist selected values.
- Predictions table must still show the active run (no overlap).
- Export buttons still work.
- Remanente still shows based on the same run filter.
- If no predictions, show a clean empty state inside the distribution card.

STYLING INSTRUCTIONS (VERY SPECIFIC)
Add a new CSS section in static/css/style.css:

/* === Dashboard Mockup Layout === */
- Use a wrapper .dash-mock
- Use .dash-topbar, .dash-runstrip, .dash-filters, .dash-kpi-grid, .dash-panel-card
- Use consistent spacing: 10–14px gaps
- Card radius: 16–18px
- Shadow: subtle (reuse existing var(--shadow) if exists)
- Background: light gradient remains (do not change body background)
- Table: compact, small font, minimal borders

DO NOT introduce new frameworks or new CSS files.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (MANDATORY ORDER)
1) Rewrite templates/dashboard.html layout to follow zones A–D exactly.
2) Keep the existing filter form, but restyle/relayout to match zone B.
3) Render only two KPI cards: “Top productos vendidos” and “Stock CD hoy”.
   - Use existing variables for values.
   - If you don’t have “Top productos vendidos number” directly, compute it from existing backend-provided top_sales length or units. If not available, show kpi_units_suggested as placeholder but label correctly (preferred: show total top_sales units if provided).
4) Create a single main card that contains predictions + remanente stacked (zone D).
5) Add a small SKU search input in predictions header (front-end only placeholder is fine).
6) Add empty state messages if predictions/stock_cd_filtered are empty.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide the full updated templates/dashboard.html
- Provide only the appended CSS block to static/css/style.css
- Do not modify any other templates or backend code.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- Dashboard renders without Jinja errors.
- Filters work.
- Exports work.
- No overlapping runs.
- Layout visually matches mockup: compact, modern, two KPI cards, one main distribution/remanent card.
