Add a basic in-app Alerts module to FastDSO (no external notifications). Use MAX_WOC and MIN_WOC consistently.

Goal:
Provide proactive alerts based on stock + sales velocity, without modifying any stock quantities or forecasts. This is read-only, computed dynamically.

Definitions:
- WOC (Weeks of Coverage) = stock / max(avg_weekly_sales, 1)
- MIN_WOC = minimum desired coverage (risk threshold)
- MAX_WOC = maximum tolerated coverage (overstock threshold)

Alert types (V01):
1) PROJECTED STOCKOUT (Store-level)
- Trigger if WOC_store < MIN_WOC and store has sales history.
- Severity:
  High: WOC < 0.5
  Medium: 0.5 <= WOC < MIN_WOC
  Low: MIN_WOC <= WOC < MIN_WOC + 0.5 (optional)

2) OVERSTOCK (Store-level and/or CD-level)
- Trigger if WOC_store > MAX_WOC (store) or WOC_global > MAX_WOC (global).
- Severity:
  High: WOC > MAX_WOC * 2
  Medium: WOC > MAX_WOC
  Low: WOC within 10% above MAX_WOC (optional)

3) SILENT SKU (Dead / no movement)
- Trigger if stock > 0 and days_since_last_sale >= DEAD_DAYS threshold:
  - Store-level: DEAD_DAYS_STORE default 60
  - CD-level: DEAD_DAYS_GLOBAL default 90
- Severity based on days since last sale.

Data sources:
- DistributionRecord (sales history by sku-store-date)
- StockSnapshot (store stock)
- StockCD (CD stock)
- Product, Store
- Lifecycle tables if present (last_sale_date_store/global). If missing, compute last sale date from DistributionRecord.

UI:
- Add a new page: /alerts
- Also add an Alerts panel on Dashboard (top section) showing top 10 alerts (highest severity first).
- Each alert row must include:
  - Severity badge (High/Medium/Low)
  - SKU + product name
  - Location (Store name or CD)
  - Reason (short)
  - Suggested action (short): e.g. “Replenish”, “Redistribute”, “Review purchase”, “Liquidate”
- Include filters on /alerts:
  - type, severity, store, sku contains
- Keep it consistent with Dashboard tables (zebra, hover, sticky header).

No schema changes required:
- Alerts should be computed on the fly.
- Do NOT store alerts permanently.

Safety:
- Do NOT change any inventory.
- Do NOT require background jobs.

Deliverables:
- Alert generation function(s)
- /alerts route + template
- Dashboard integration panel (read-only)
- Ensure no backend regressions and preserve SKU leading zeros.
