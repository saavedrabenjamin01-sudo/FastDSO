TASK: Redesign the Dashboard template to match the provided mockup style while preserving 100% of current functionality.

CONTEXT
FastDSO is a Flask + Jinja + Bootstrap app with:
- Runs Center (run_id selection / active run)
- Dashboard filters (store, folio, responsable, run selector if exists)
- KPI cards
- Tables: Top sales, Suggested distribution, CD remainder
- Exports and pagination
- Role-based permissions
- Job-based processing for heavy uploads
We must NOT break any of these.

GOAL (UI)
Update ONLY the Dashboard UI to match the mockup:
- Clean topbar with global search input (placeholder)
- Filter strip (run/folio/store/responsable) with compact inputs
- KPI cards in a row (2–4 cards) with large numbers
- Two main tables side-by-side (Top sales left, Suggested distribution right)
- Remainder table below, full width
- Card-based layout, rounded corners, soft shadows, blue accents consistent with sidebar
- Keep the sidebar and base layout intact

HARD RULES
1) Do NOT change backend logic, routes, query results, or database schema.
2) Do NOT remove any existing template variables. Only reorganize how they are displayed.
3) Preserve all existing buttons and actions:
   - Apply filters / Clear
   - Export distribution
   - Export remanente
   - Pagination controls (if present)
4) Preserve Run behavior:
   - Dashboard must show the currently selected/active run as before.
   - If run_id selector exists, keep it. If not, keep current active run logic untouched.
5) Preserve role-based visibility:
   - Buttons/sections only show if current permissions allow.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Template work:
- Modify templates/dashboard.html (only) to restructure layout.
- Keep current Jinja blocks and variables:
  stores, selected_store, folio, responsable, predictions, top_sales, stock_cd_filtered,
  kpi_units_suggested, kpi_skus_distintos, kpi_tiendas_alcanzadas, kpi_stock_cd_total,
  export endpoints, and any run-related vars (runs list / selected_run_id / active_run).
- Ensure loops keep correct unpacking:
  - predictions: for p, prod, st in predictions
  - stock_cd_filtered: for cd, prod in stock_cd_filtered
  - top_sales: use row.sku / row.product / row.store / row.units (or current structure)

B) Styling:
- Add minimal new CSS to static/css/style.css under a “Dashboard V1.1” section:
  - .dash-wrap, .dash-topbar, .dash-filters, .dash-kpis, .dash-card, .dash-table
  - Rounded corners (16–18px), subtle shadow, light background, blue accent borders
  - Make tables compact, align headers, keep sticky table header optional
- Do NOT create a new CSS file. Extend existing.

C) Components to include (matching mockup):
1) Topbar:
- Left: page title “Panel”
- Right: global search input (disabled placeholder is fine)
2) Filters block:
- Run summary line (folio + responsable + date) if available
- Store dropdown
- Folio text filter
- Responsable text filter
- Buttons: Apply / Clear
3) KPI row:
- Units suggested
- SKUs with distribution
- Stores reached
- Stock CD today (or current snapshot total)
4) Tables row:
- Left: Top sales (top 10) with search field (optional, can be placeholder)
- Right: Suggested distribution (top 10) + Export button on header
5) Remainder:
- Full width table + Export remanente button

D) Keep functionality:
- Keep all form names and query params unchanged.
- Keep export URL parameters unchanged.
- Keep existing pagination markup if present (just restyle/relocate).
- Ensure no JS changes required.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- Dashboard loads with no Jinja errors.
- Filters apply correctly and persist selected values.
- Exports still work.
- Runs selection (if present) still works and prevents overlap.
- All KPI numbers match backend values.
- Layout visually matches mockup: compact, modern, card-based.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide the updated templates/dashboard.html and the appended CSS changes in style.css.
- Do not modify other templates unless absolutely necessary.
