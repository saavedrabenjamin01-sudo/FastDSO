Implement a “Runs History” system across the app so that sales uploads, distribution predictions, and purchase forecast V2 are versioned and never mixed.

GOALS
	1.	Create a new DB model Run:

	•	id (uuid string, primary key or unique indexed)
	•	created_at (utc datetime)
	•	run_type (string: “sales_upload”, “distribution”, “forecast_v2”)
	•	folio (nullable string)
	•	responsable (nullable string)
	•	categoria (nullable string)
	•	store_filter (nullable string)
	•	notes/json_meta (nullable text/json) for future metadata
	•	status (string: “completed”/“failed”)

	2.	Link data to runs:

	•	Add run_id FK (or indexed string) to:
	•	DistributionRecord (sales rows) -> run_id
	•	Prediction -> run_id
	•	Forecast tables/results (whatever model V2 uses) -> run_id
	•	Ensure SKU string formatting is preserved exactly (leading zeros).

	3.	On /upload (sales):

	•	Generate a new run_id when user uploads sales.
	•	Save that run row with meta fields from the form.
	•	Attach run_id to all inserted DistributionRecord rows.
	•	When generate_predictions is called, it must:
	•	use ONLY df for that run (not historical DB)
	•	save predictions with the same run_id

	4.	On forecast_v2:

	•	Generate a run_id each time forecast is generated
	•	Store results with that run_id + the meta fields
	•	Export should export the selected run_id

	5.	UI:

	•	Add a “Runs” page showing the last 50 runs with columns:
created_at, run_type, folio, responsable, categoria, store_filter, status
	•	Each run has “View” that opens:
	•	For distribution runs: show predictions + remanente + top sales for that run
	•	For sales runs: show top sales summary for that run
	•	For forecast_v2: show forecast results for that run
	•	Dashboard should default to “latest distribution run” and must never show merged predictions from older runs.

	6.	Migration:

	•	Since this is a test app, migration can be destructive:
	•	If sqlite migration is complex, it’s acceptable to reset the sqlite DB and recreate tables.
	•	Provide exact instructions or code that recreates DB cleanly.

VALIDATION
	•	Run two different uploads with different SKUs (e.g., Consoles then Games)
	•	Confirm dashboard “Distribución sugerida” shows ONLY the latest distribution run
	•	Confirm filters allow selecting an older run and viewing it without mixing.

DELIVERABLE
	•	List all files changed and show the final code diffs.
	•	Keep changes minimal and safe.
