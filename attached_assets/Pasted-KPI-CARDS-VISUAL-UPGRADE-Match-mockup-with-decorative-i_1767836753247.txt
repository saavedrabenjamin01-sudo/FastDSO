KPI CARDS VISUAL UPGRADE — Match mockup with decorative illustration (Dashboard only)

Context:
We already have 2 KPI cards in dashboard.html:
- “Top productos vendidos”
- “Stock CD hoy”
They work functionally. We need to upgrade ONLY their visual design to match the mockup style:
- soft gradient background
- large number on the left
- decorative illustration/shape on the right side inside the card (like a mini dashboard/warehouse illustration)
- keep the admin “three dots” dropdown for resets inside the Stock CD card (no need for reset icons on the card)

Scope (strict):
- Only edit KPI card HTML block inside templates/dashboard.html
- Append CSS only to static/css/style.css (do not overwrite)
- No backend changes, no variable changes, no other sections touched.

Design requirements (must match mockup):
1) Card layout:
- Left side: label (small), big number (dominant)
- Right side: decorative illustration area (non-interactive) with soft shapes
- Card must have rounded corners and subtle shadow
- Background must be a very subtle gradient (blue tint for Top Sales, blue/teal tint for Stock CD)

2) Decorative illustration:
- Use pure CSS + simple inline SVG OR CSS pseudo-elements (preferred: pseudo-elements so it’s lightweight).
- Create a “card-art” container positioned absolute on the right:
  - soft rectangles/lines like a mini chart/document for “Top productos vendidos”
  - warehouse/building + small boxes feel for “Stock CD hoy”
- Must not affect the card height or push content.
- Should be subtle, not too saturated.

3) Typography:
- Label: 12–13px, muted
- Number: 34–40px, bold, strong contrast
- Optional small subtext under number (e.g., “últimos 7 días” / “disponible”) but keep it subtle.

4) Keep existing dropdown:
- Keep the three-dots dropdown menu on Stock CD card as-is and aligned top-right.
- Ensure it stays clickable above the decorative art (z-index).

Implementation instructions:
A) dashboard.html changes:
- For each KPI card add a class:
  - Top sales card: dash-kpi-card dash-kpi-art-sales
  - Stock CD card: dash-kpi-card dash-kpi-art-cd
- Add an empty div inside each card for the illustration:
  <div class="dash-kpi-art"></div>
- Do not remove the existing icon badge if present, but you may reduce its visual weight or hide it if it conflicts (preferred: keep a small badge on left, mockup uses art on right).

B) style.css changes (append):
Add a new block under:
  /* === KPI mockup art === */
Define:
- .dash-kpi-card { position: relative; overflow: hidden; }
- .dash-kpi-art { position:absolute; right:10px; top:50%; transform:translateY(-50%); width:180px; height:70px; opacity:.9; pointer-events:none; }
- For sales art:
  - use :before/:after gradients and small bars/lines
- For cd art:
  - use :before/:after to draw a simple “warehouse” silhouette + small box shapes
- Ensure numbers/text remain fully readable (z-index above art).

Acceptance criteria:
- KPI cards visually resemble the reference: big number left, soft illustration on right, clean minimal label.
- No functional change.
- Dropdown menu still works and is not blocked by art.

Deliverables:
- Show the updated KPI HTML snippet in dashboard.html.
- Show appended CSS only.
