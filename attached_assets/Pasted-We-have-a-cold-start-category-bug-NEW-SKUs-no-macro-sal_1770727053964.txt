We have a cold_start_category bug: NEW SKUs (no macro sales) still produce 0 predictions if the SKU has ANY store stock in at least one store.

Current behavior (from debug):
- SKUs without macro sales: 1
- SKUs with any store stock: 1
- SKUs eligible for cold start (no sales AND no stock): 0
=> The eligibility requires BOTH no sales AND no stock globally, so the SKU is excluded from cold start and also excluded from sales-based, yielding 0.

GOAL:
A SKU with NO SALES must always be eligible for cold_start_category, even if some stores already have stock.
Cold start should allocate per-store based on category store ranking + per-store stock gap. Stores that already have enough stock get 0, others receive units.

CHANGES REQUIRED:

1) FIX ELIGIBILITY CONDITION
- Replace global condition:
    eligible_cold_start = (no_sales AND no_stock_anywhere)
  with:
    eligible_cold_start = (no_sales)
- Keep a separate flag:
    has_any_store_stock = True/False
  but DO NOT use it to block cold_start.

2) IMPLEMENT PER-STORE GAP ALLOCATION FOR COLD START
For each target store:
- Compute store_stock_sku (0 if missing).
- Determine desired target units:
  Option A (preferred): use category proxy demand (weekly mean for category) * target_woc, then:
      desired_units = ceil(category_proxy_weekly * target_woc)
  Option B (fallback if proxy unavailable): starter_units = 1 or 2
- Then:
      needed = max(0, desired_units - store_stock_sku)

3) STORE SELECTION (TOP N)
- Rank stores by category strength (category share / recent category sales) using MacroSales/SalesWeeklyAgg.
- For cold start, default topN = 20.
- Allocate only to topN stores, but allow 0 for stores whose stock already covers desired_units.

4) MINIMUM PRESENCE RULE (IMPORTANT)
Even if a store has weak category rank, if it has RECENT category activity OR is within rank <= topN, it should be eligible.
But do NOT allocate if needed == 0.
If cd_stock > 0 and total allocations still == 0 (edge-case), force allocate 1 unit to the best stores that have store_stock_sku == 0 until cd_stock runs out (log reason FORCE_MIN_ALLOC).

5) DEBUG OUTPUT
For cold start SKUs, print a concise per-store debug table for the targeted SKU:
- store_name, rank, category_proxy_weekly, target_units, store_stock_sku, needed, allocated, reason_code

6) REGRESSION SAFETY
- Do not change sales-based SMA models logic.
- Ensure cold start path is only used when sku has NO sales history in macro.
- Keep performance acceptable (debug behind flag).

EXPECTED RESULT:
If a SKU has no sales, we should get predictions > 0 whenever CD stock exists and there are eligible stores with store_stock_sku < desired_units.
Stores that already have stock should not necessarily receive more.
