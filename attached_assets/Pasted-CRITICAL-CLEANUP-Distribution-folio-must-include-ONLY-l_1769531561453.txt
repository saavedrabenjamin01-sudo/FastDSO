CRITICAL CLEANUP — Distribution folio must include ONLY lines with qty > 0 (UI + Export + FastPlanner)

Problem:
The “Distribución sugerida” view and export currently include ALL SKUs, including rows where suggested quantity = 0.
This creates huge useless files and pollutes FastPlanner plans. Operationally, a 0-qty line should not exist.

Goal:
Filter distribution lines everywhere so only qty > 0 is displayed, exported, and sent to FastPlanner.

Scope:
- Dashboard / run detail distribution table
- Export distribution endpoint
- Approve-and-send-to-FastPlanner snapshot creation (DistributionPlanLine)

Rules:
- A valid distribution line is: Prediction.quantity > 0
- Do NOT delete predictions with qty=0 from DB (keep for analytics if needed), but NEVER show them as part of a folio/plan.

Tasks:

A) UI (dashboard.html / run_detail.html)
1) In the “Distribución sugerida” table query/loop, show only rows where p.quantity > 0.
2) Pagination totals should reflect only qty > 0 rows.
3) Add a small label like: “Mostrando solo líneas con cantidad > 0”.

B) Export endpoint (export_predictions)
1) Export ONLY rows where quantity > 0 for the selected run_id.
2) Preserve SKU as text (leading zeros).
3) Include columns: folio/run_id, sku, product_name, store, quantity.
4) File size should reduce drastically.

C) FastPlanner integration (approve_and_send)
When creating DistributionPlanLine from a run’s predictions:
- Insert ONLY predictions where quantity > 0.
- Plan header totals (units, lines, stores) must be computed from qty > 0 lines only.
- If a run has zero positive lines, block approval with a clear message:
  “No hay cantidades positivas para enviar a bodega.”

D) Safety checks
- Ensure no UI or export or plan creation includes qty=0 lines.
- Do not break existing analytics; only filter for operational artifacts.

Deliverables:
- Updated queries/filters in UI
- Updated export query
- Updated FastPlanner plan creation logic
- Confirm file export and plan lines are smaller and clean
