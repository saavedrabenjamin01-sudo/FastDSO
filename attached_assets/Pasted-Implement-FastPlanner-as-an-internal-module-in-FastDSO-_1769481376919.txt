Implement FastPlanner as an internal module in FastDSO with a Kanban board for warehouse execution.

Scope:
- Add models (if not existing): DistributionPlan, DistributionPlanLine, PlanActivityLog
- Add routes + templates
- Add sidebar menu entry under Operaciones: “FastPlanner”
- Align UI with FastDSO design (cards, pills, rounded corners, soft shadows, blue/white palette)
- Do NOT modify distribution calculation logic.

A) Models (SQLAlchemy)
1) DistributionPlan
- id (pk)
- folio (unique string)
- source_run_id (string / fk if you have runs table)
- status (string enum-like)
- urgency (LOW/MEDIUM/URGENT)
- notes_commercial (text)
- notes_warehouse (text)
- created_by_user_id
- approved_by_user_id
- assigned_to_user_id (nullable)
- created_at, approved_at, started_at, closed_at

2) DistributionPlanLine
- id (pk)
- plan_id (fk)
- product_id (fk)
- store_id (fk)
- qty_planned (int)
- line_notes (text, nullable)

3) PlanActivityLog
- id
- plan_id
- action (string)
- user_id
- timestamp
- comment (text)

B) Kanban statuses (FastPlanner board columns)
Create columns:
- APPROVED
- IN_PROGRESS
- PACKED
- DISPATCHED
- CLOSED
(Optional: BLOCKED)

C) Routes
1) GET /planner
- Shows Kanban board
- Filters: status, urgency, search by folio (optional)
- Each column lists cards (plans) in that status

2) POST /planner/<plan_id>/take
- Only allowed if status=APPROVED
- Set assigned_to=current_user
- status -> IN_PROGRESS
- started_at set
- log activity: TAKEN

3) POST /planner/<plan_id>/pack
- Only allowed if status=IN_PROGRESS
- status -> PACKED
- log activity: PACKED

4) POST /planner/<plan_id>/dispatch
- Only allowed if status=PACKED
- status -> DISPATCHED
- log activity: DISPATCHED

5) POST /planner/<plan_id>/close
- Only allowed if status=DISPATCHED
- status -> CLOSED
- closed_at set
- log activity: CLOSED

6) GET /planner/<plan_id>
- Plan detail view (or modal page)
- Shows header summary + lines table (paginated 10/page)
- Notes textarea for warehouse notes (POST /planner/<plan_id>/notes)

7) GET /planner/<plan_id>/export_picking
- Export Excel picking list:
  sku (text), product_name, store, qty_planned
- Preserve leading zeros

D) UI Template (templates/planner.html + templates/planner_detail.html)
1) planner.html Kanban
- Use a 5-column responsive grid
- Each column has:
  title + count badge
  list of plan cards
- Plan cards:
  folio (big)
  urgency pill (color)
  chips: SKUs, Units, Stores
  meta: approved_at, assigned_to
  actions:
    - Take (only if APPROVED)
    - View details
    - Export picking
- Keep consistent FastDSO styles and spacing

2) planner_detail.html
- Summary card
- Lines table (zebra/hover/sticky header)
- Warehouse notes
- Activity timeline (PlanActivityLog) in a side card

E) Permissions
- Only Warehouse role (or ops permission) can take/pack/dispatch/close
- Manager/Admin can view
- Respect existing has_permission patterns

F) Integration point (assume approval already creates plans)
- FastPlanner should show any DistributionPlan with status APPROVED
- If no plans exist, show empty state “No approved distributions yet”

Deliverables:
- New models (if needed), routes, templates
- Sidebar entry
- Kanban board fully functional
- Export picking list works
- Activity log works
