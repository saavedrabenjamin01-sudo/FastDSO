ALERTS MODULE UI UPGRADE — Group chips by Severity and by Type, make chips selectable, remove classic filters

Context:
We have an Alerts page showing:
- Severity chips (High/Medium/Low)
- Type chips (Projected stockout, Overstock, No movement, Active stockout with demand)
- A list/table of alert rows + classic filter controls (dropdowns/inputs)

Goal:
1) Visually group chips into two groups:
   A) Severity group
   B) Alert Type group
2) Chips must be clickable and multi-selectable.
3) Selecting chips filters the table results below.
4) Remove/replace classic filter UI (dropdowns/inputs) with chip selection (chips become the filters).
5) Allow selecting multiple severities and multiple types simultaneously (combined filtering).
6) Provide "Clear selection" button.
7) Maintain performance: server-side filtering + pagination (10 per page default).

Strict rules:
- Do NOT change alert generation/business logic.
- Do NOT store large selections in cookies/sessions.
- Use query parameters to represent chip selection:
   severity=high,medium
   type=overstock,projected_stockout
- Keep pagination working with selected filters.
- Keep consistent FastDSO styling (cards, chips, soft shadows).

Implementation details:

A) UI Layout (templates/alerts.html)
1) Create two chip groups inside a top card:
   - Header: “Filtrar por Severidad”
     chips: High, Medium, Low
   - Header: “Filtrar por Tipo”
     chips: Projected Stockout, Overstock, No Movement, Active Stockout w/ Demand (or Spanish labels)
2) Chips are toggle buttons:
   - Clicking toggles selected state.
   - Selected chips visually highlighted (stronger background/border).
   - Non-selected remain subtle.
3) Add a small summary line:
   “Selected: High + Overstock + No Movement”
4) Add a "Clear" button:
   - Clears severity and type selections (removes params from URL)
5) Remove existing dropdown/text filter controls from the page (or hide them).

B) Chip behavior (no heavy JS frameworks)
Option 1 (recommended): Use lightweight JS to update URL query params:
- Maintain two arrays:
  selectedSeverities, selectedTypes
- On click:
  toggle value in array
  update URL params:
    severity=comma-separated
    type=comma-separated
  reset page param to 1
  reload page (server-side filtering)
This keeps server-side pagination consistent and avoids huge client-side lists.

C) Backend filtering (alerts route)
- Parse request args:
  severities = request.args.get("severity","").split(",") (ignore empty)
  types = request.args.get("type","").split(",")
- Filter the alerts dataset at the source (SQL query or computed list):
  - If severities list non-empty => include only those severities
  - If types list non-empty => include only those types
- Keep existing sorting by severity first, then impact.
- Paginate filtered alerts (10 per page default).
- Pass to template:
  selected_severities, selected_types, alert_rows, pagination

D) Click behavior “show products for that chip”
This is automatically achieved by chip selection filter:
- Clicking a chip triggers filtered results below.
- Multi-select shows combined results.

E) Nice-to-have UI
- Add “Select all” small link for severity and type groups (optional).
- Add badge counts on chips:
  e.g., High (12), Overstock (34)
  Use aggregated counts computed once (fast) and shown next to each chip.
  (Do not recompute heavy lists multiple times.)

F) Acceptance criteria
- Chips are grouped: severity group + type group.
- User can select multiple chips in each group.
- Table reflects combined selection.
- “Clear selection” resets.
- Pagination preserves filters.
- No classic dropdown filters remain.

Deliverables:
- Updated alerts template with grouped selectable chips
- Updated alerts route to accept severity/type params and paginate
- Minimal JS helper for toggling chips and updating URL params
- Keep performance stable
