SIDEBAR FINAL POLISH — hover/active states + hierarchy (CSS-only, minimal HTML if needed)

Context:
Sidebar is already rounded and functional. We want the final premium polish:
- Clear hover feedback
- Clear active state (where the user is)
- Better hierarchy: group headers > subitems
- Subtle micro animations (not flashy)
Keep colors within existing blue/white scheme.

Strict rules:
- Do NOT change menu order, routes, or permissions logic.
- Prefer CSS-only changes in static/css/style.css.
- Do NOT restructure sidebar HTML.
- Keep collapse behavior intact.

Tasks:

1) Active state (nav-link.active)
Make the active item clearly visible:
- Slightly stronger background than hover
- Add a subtle left accent bar (2–3px) using ::before
- Keep rounded corners
- Ensure active state does NOT look “overdone”

2) Hover state (nav-link:hover)
- Background increase slightly
- Micro movement translateX(2px)
- Smooth transition 150ms
- Icon box slightly brightens

3) Hierarchy
- Group toggles (nav-group-toggle) should look heavier than subitems:
  - slightly larger height
  - font-weight 800
  - icon container slightly larger than subitems
- Subitems:
  - font-weight 600–700
  - slightly smaller text
  - icon container smaller

4) Icon containers
- Style .nav-icon as a soft square:
  width: 34px; height: 34px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.10)
- On hover: background becomes rgba(255,255,255,0.16)
- Keep icon centered

5) Micro animation
- Add transition to:
  background, transform, border-color, box-shadow
- Add minimal “lift” on hover (no more than 1px)

6) Accessibility
- Ensure focus-visible state for keyboard navigation:
  outline or box-shadow in soft cyan/blue.

Implementation:
- Append CSS at end of style.css under comment:
  /* === Sidebar final polish === */

Provide CSS that targets:
- .sidebar .nav-link
- .sidebar .nav-link.active
- .sidebar .nav-group-toggle
- .sidebar .nav-icon
- .sidebar .nav-link:focus-visible

Acceptance:
- Hover feels responsive and premium
- Active item is obvious at a glance
- Group headers visually stronger than subitems
- No layout shifts or broken collapse behavior

Deliverable:
- Only the appended CSS snippet.
