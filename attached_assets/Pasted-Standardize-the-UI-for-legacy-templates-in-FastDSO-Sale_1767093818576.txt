Standardize the UI for legacy templates in FastDSO:
- Sales upload (Carga Ventas)
- Store stock upload (Stock Tiendas)
- CD stock upload (Stock CD)
- Stock query (Consulta de stock)

Goal:
- All these pages should use a consistent layout: title header, compact description, card-based form, clear CTA buttons, and consistent spacing.
- Add a “processing overlay popup” (loading screen) for any form that uploads a file or triggers heavy processing:
  - Sales upload (file + prediction generation)
  - Store stock upload
  - CD stock upload
  - Any recalculation action (forecast, rebalance, exports if needed)

Requirements:
1) Base components:
- Create a reusable Jinja partial: templates/partials/_upload_card.html
  - Parameters: title, subtitle, icon_svg, form_action, file_accept, extra_fields_block, primary_cta_text
- Create another reusable partial: templates/partials/_processing_overlay.html
  - A full-screen translucent overlay with a centered modal card
  - Shows:
    - an icon (SVG) related to action
    - a message: “Processing… Please wait”
    - a spinner animation
  - Overlay is hidden by default.

2) Loader behavior:
- When the user submits a form, show the overlay immediately:
  - Use JS: onsubmit handler OR addEventListener('submit')
  - Disable submit button and show progress state.
- Add a timeout fallback message after 10 seconds: “Still working…”
- The overlay must be accessible (aria-live) and not block server response.

3) Visual design:
- Keep your current blue/white scheme + elegant sidebar gradient.
- Improve spacing:
  - Add consistent padding on main content
  - Tables should have breathing room and not touch sidebar
  - Cards should have consistent radius and shadows
- Add nicer empty-states:
  - If no data, show a small illustration/icon + message.

4) Icons:
- Use inline SVG icons (not external libs) for:
  - Upload sales
  - Upload store stock
  - Upload CD stock
  - Stock query
  - Processing overlay (animated spinner)
- Place icons in the card header area.

5) Standardized forms:
- For uploads:
  - Show accepted columns/format in a collapsible “File requirements” section
  - Show the last upload timestamp if available (from backend)
- For stock query:
  - Provide tabs or segmented control: “CD Stock” vs “Store Stock”
  - Make filters consistent with dashboard filters.

6) Files:
- Put global CSS additions in static/css/style.css
- Put JS in static/js/app_ui.js
- Ensure base.html loads app_ui.js once and only once.
- Do not break existing routes.

Deliverables:
- Updated templates for the 4 pages using the new partials
- New partials
- CSS + JS additions
- Confirm loaders appear on submit and disappear after page load (naturally, since navigation happens).
