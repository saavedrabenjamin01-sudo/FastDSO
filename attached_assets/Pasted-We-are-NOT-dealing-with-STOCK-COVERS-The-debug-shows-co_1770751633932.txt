We are NOT dealing with STOCK_COVERS. The debug shows cold-start is producing ZERO predictions because 68 SKUs have no macro sales data and then get skipped with reason=NO_ELIGIBLE_STORES.

Please fix the distribution pipeline with these changes:

A) Correct SKU classification for a DistributionRequest
1) For each requested SKU, query MacroSales (or SalesWeeklyAgg based on macro) for that SKU in the active window.
2) Classify as:
   - sales_based ONLY IF macro sales rows exist (sum_units > 0 or rows > 0)
   - cold_start_category IF no macro sales rows exist AND category is present
   - skipped_no_category IF category missing
3) Update the upload summary to reflect this real classification (it currently says sales-based 121 but macro data exists for only 56, which is wrong).

B) Fix cold-start eligible store selection (NO_ELIGIBLE_STORES)
Cold-start must not require SKU-level sales or SKU-level stock. It should use CATEGORY store hierarchy:
1) Build store_category_rank = stores sorted by category sales (from Macro Sales) in the same window.
2) Eligible stores for cold_start:
   - default: top N stores by category sales (N = 20)
   - optionally: if store is closed/inactive, exclude (but do not over-filter)
3) If after filtering we still have 0 eligible stores:
   - fallback to overall top 20 stores by total sales (all categories) OR
   - fallback to all stores with any stock snapshot (choose one deterministic fallback)
   - log fallback reason: COLD_START_FALLBACK_USED

C) Cold-start allocation rule
When CD stock exists:
1) Allocate proportionally to category weights (store share of category sales).
2) Enforce min allocation for top stores:
   - for top 10 stores: min 1 unit each until CD stock is exhausted
3) Respect CD stock limit strictly.

D) Logging
Add a concise per-SKU debug line when cold_start is used or skipped:
- sku, category, cd_stock, eligible_store_count, reason_code
Make sure NO_ELIGIBLE_STORES can only happen if ALL fallbacks fail, and in that case include why (no category sales found, no stores, etc).

After changes:
- Cold-start SKUs must produce predictions if CD stock > 0 and category exists, even if SKU has zero sales history.
- Upload summary counts must match macro sales reality.
