Use spacing (margin / padding) instead of visible borders to separate sections.

⸻

2️⃣ Dashboard header (“Panel”)
	•	Keep the title text “Panel”
	•	Style it as:
	•	font-size: 1.4rem
	•	font-weight: 600
	•	The global search input must:
	•	Stay disabled (as currently)
	•	Have rounded pill shape

	•	“Clear” → secondary / outline

❗ Do NOT change form method, action, or input names.

5️⃣ KPI cards (Top products sold / Stock CD today)

Redesign KPI cards to look like real KPIs, not plain labels:

	•	Large number:
	•	font-size: ~2rem
	•	font-weight: 700
	•	Label smaller and muted

	•	Subtitle (model name / run metadata) in muted text
	•	Header background: #f0f3f8
	•	Actions aligned right:
	•	SKU search input
	•	Export button (primary)

Table styling
	•	Header row with light gray background
	•	More vertical padding in rows
	•	Improve readability without changing data

⸻

7️⃣ “CD Remaining Stock” section
	•	Use the exact same visual structure as “Suggested Distribution”
	•	Same header style
	•	Same table style
	•	Same spacing logic

⸻

8️⃣ Strict rules
	•	❌ Do NOT remove any existing block
	•	❌ Do NOT rename Jinja variables
	•	❌ Do NOT break pagination, searching, exporting
	•	❌ Do NOT simplify logic

⸻

9️⃣ Final requirement

When finished:
	•	Explicitly list what was changed in dashboard.html
	•	Explicitly list what was added or modified in style.css
	•	Confirm that no backend logic was altered

The dashboard must visually resemble a modern SaaS analytics panel, similar to the provided reference image, while remaining fully functional.
