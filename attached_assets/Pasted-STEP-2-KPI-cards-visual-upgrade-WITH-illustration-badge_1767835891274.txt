STEP 2 — KPI cards visual upgrade WITH illustration badge (Dashboard)

Context:
You are editing ONLY:
- templates/dashboard.html (KPI section)
- static/css/style.css (append-only styles)

Goal:
Make the KPI cards visually match the mockup, INCLUDING the small illustration/icon badge on the left side of each card.

IMPORTANT:
This step MUST include a visible circular icon badge per KPI card.
If the badge is missing, the task is NOT complete.

Rules (strict):
1) Do NOT change backend logic, variables, or queries.
2) Do NOT rename or remove any existing KPI variables.
3) Do NOT add or remove KPI cards (still exactly 2).
4) Do NOT affect filters, tables, pagination, or other sections.
5) Only refine HTML structure inside the existing KPI cards.
6) Existing admin dropdown (three dots) must remain functional.

Required KPI card structure (HTML):
Each KPI card must have this visual hierarchy:

- Left: circular icon badge (soft background)
  - Icon centered (Bootstrap Icon already used)
- Right:
  - Small muted label (top)
  - Large bold number (main focus)
  - Optional subtle subtext (very small)

Example hierarchy (conceptual, not literal copy):
[ ICON BADGE ]  Top products sold
               38
               last 7 days

Specific requirements:
- Icon badge:
  - Perfect circle
  - Soft background color (blue/green tint)
  - Icon color slightly stronger than background
- Number:
  - Largest text in the card
- Label:
  - Smaller, muted, uppercase or letter-spaced
- Card:
  - Soft shadow
  - Rounded corners
  - Slight hover lift (translateY)

CSS requirements (append at bottom of style.css under comment):
/* Dashboard KPI polish */

- Increase KPI number font-size to ~36px
- Reduce label font-size to ~12px
- Add letter-spacing to label
- Add subtle gradient or background to card
- Add hover effect:
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  transition: 150ms ease;

Acceptance criteria (must all be true):
- KPI cards visually resemble the mockup cards.
- Each KPI clearly has a circular illustration badge.
- Numbers visually dominate the card.
- No layout breaks.
- No loss of permissions or functionality.

Deliverables:
- Updated KPI section HTML (only that block).
- Appended CSS snippet (only new styles).
